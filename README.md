Snake
===

IN PROGRESS - Snake game built in Javascript and HTML
---

### Gems & Libraries

*  Underscore.js
*  JQuery

### Getting Started

1.  Open index.html in your browswer

### Controls

*  Press Enter to get your snake rolling. User the arrow keys to move him around.
*  *Snake* should be frought with peril; each step towards that golden apple is another step towards your destiny. This is a more casual take on the game. You wander aimlessly, and don't grow too big for your britches - or at all! And no apples!

### Goals

This was a quick project to practice building things in Javascript, and to get familiar with Underscore and Jquery.

### Credits

This game was written in collaboration with Sarah Quigley - github.com/sarahquigley.
